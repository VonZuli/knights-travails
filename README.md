#TOP-Knights-Travails

This project is aimed at applying knowledge from previous Odin Project lessons about algorithims to an actual problem.

The task is to build a function that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all the squares a knight from the game of chess will stop on along the way.

Given enough turns a knight is able to move from any square on an 8x8 chess board to any other square using it's standard "L" shaped movement. (2 spaces in any one direction and 1 step perpendicular to the initial chosen direction; or 1 step in one direction and 2 spaces perpendicular)

Possible Future Implementations:
-Improve GUI implementation.
